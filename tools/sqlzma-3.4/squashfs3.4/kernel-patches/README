Readme for Linux-2.6.27 users.

The VFS interface in the rc candidates has not stabilised sufficiently to
produce one patch that is guaranteed to work once Linux-2.6.27 is released.
Linux-2.6.27-rc4 has some minor VFS changes, but there are further up and
coming changes in the linux-next tree (linux-2.6.27-rc4-next) that probably
will make it into the final Linux 2.6.27 release.

If you're using Linux-2.6.27-rc4 use the linux-2.6.27-rc4 patch.  If you're
using a later rc candidate or the final release, first try the
linux-2.6.27-rc4-next patch.
