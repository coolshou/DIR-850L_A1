			INSTALLING SQUASHFS

The squashfs3.4.tar.gz file contains the kernel-patches directory containing
the squashfs patches, and the squashfs-tools directory containing mksquashfs
and unsquashfs.

1. Patching the kernel
----------------------

There are twelve kernel patch directories depending on your linux kernel
version.  If your kernel version isn't there then try the patch for the nearest
kernel.

To patch your kernel, cd into the top level directory, and run the "patch"
command, e.g. assuming linux-2.6.22

%cd /usr/src/linux-2.6.22
%patch -p1 < location-of-squashfs/kernel-patches/linux-2.6.22/squashfs3.4-patch

Where "location-of-squashfs" is the path to the squashfs3.4 source directory.

The squashfs patches patch the relevant kernel files to add configure support,
initrd support, include files, and the squashfs directory under linux/fs/.
Once patched, the kernel must be reconfigured, with squashfs support turned on
(either Y/M) to ensure that inflate support is built into the kernel.  The
squashfs kernel option can be found in the miscellaneous filesystems submenu
near the bottom of the filesystems submenu.

There are a set of options which are intended for use by embedded systems with
low memory.  At the "Additional option for memory-constrained systems" prompt,
please say NO unless you're using an embedded system!  Saying Y here allows you
to specify cache sizes.

The "Number of fragments cached" prompt allows the number of fragments cached
to be controlled.  By default SquashFS caches the last 3 fragments read from
the filesystem.  Increasing this amount may mean SquashFS has to re-read
fragments less often from disk, at the expense of extra system memory.
Decreasing this amount will mean SquashFS uses less memory at the expense of
extra reads from disk.  Note there must be at least one cached fragment.
Anything much more than three will probably not make much difference.

2. Building squashfs tools
--------------------------

The squashfs-tools directory contains the mksquashfs and unsquashfs programs.
These can be made by typing make.  The source files use a local copy of
squashfs_fs.h (included in the kernel patches) allowing the tools to be made
without needing to patch the kernel.
