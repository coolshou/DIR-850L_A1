Release Notes
=============

* 0.10 "Freedom"  January, 2012


General notes
-------------
This release is binary compatible with 0.8 and 0.9.

See the Changelog file for a list of significant changes. Note, there
are many more new features and bugfixes than whats listed there.

Bugreports against FFmpeg git master or the most recent FFmpeg release are
accepted. If you are experiencing issues with any formally released version of
FFmpeg, please try git master to check if the issue still exists. If it does,
make your report against the development code following the usual bug reporting
guidelines.


API changes
-----------

A number of additional APIs have been introduced and some existing
functions have been deprecated and are scheduled for removal in the next
release. Significant API changes include:

* new audio decoding API which decodes from an AVPacket to an AVFrame and
is able to use AVCodecContext.get_buffer() in the similar way as video decoding.

* new audio encoding API which encodes from an AVFrame to an AVPacket, thus
allowing it to properly output timing information and side data.

Please see the git history and the file doc/APIchanges for details.


Other notable changes
---------------------

Libavcodec and libavformat built as shared libraries now hide non-public
symbols. This will break applications using those symbols. Possible solutions
are, in order of preference:
1) Try finding a way of accomplishing the same with public API.
2) If there is no corresponding public API, but you think there should be,
post a request on the developer mailing list or IRC channel.
3) Finally if your program needs access to FFmpeg / libavcodec / libavformat
internals for some special reason then the best solution is to link statically.

Please see the Changelog file and git history for a more detailed list of changes.
