 *   text is the challenge (including angle-brackets). The client
 *   MUST NOT interpret or attempt to validate the contents of the
 *   challenge in any way.
 *
 *   This shared secret is a string known only to the client and

 *   is sent in hexadecimal format, using lower-case US-ASCII
 *   characters.
