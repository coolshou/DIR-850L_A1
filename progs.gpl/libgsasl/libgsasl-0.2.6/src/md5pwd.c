/**
 * gsasl_simple_getpass:
 * @filename: filename of file containing passwords.
 * @username: username string.
 * @key: newly allocated output character array.
 *
 * Retrieve password for user from specified file.  The buffer @key
 * contain the password if this function is successful.  The caller is
 * responsible for deallocating it.
 *
 * The file should be on the UoW "MD5 Based Authentication" format,
 * which means it is in text format with comments denoted by # first
 * on the line, with user entries looking as username\tpassword.  This
 * function removes \r and \n at the end of lines before processing.
 *
 * Return value: Return GSASL_OK if output buffer contains the
 *   password, GSASL_AUTHENTICATION_ERROR if the user could not be
 *   found, or other error code.
