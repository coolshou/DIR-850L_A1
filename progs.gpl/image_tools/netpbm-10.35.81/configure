# You may be wondering why we have this shell script instead of just
# naming buildtools/configure.pl 'configure' and letting the user
# invoke it with a 'configure' command directly.  The reason is that
# that would depend upon the user having a suitable perl interpreter
# in /usr/bin/perl, which is nowhere near as dependable as that he has
# a suitable Bourne shell interpreter at /bin/sh.  (An alternative that
# has been suggested is to code "#!/usr/bin/env perl" in configure.pl,
# but even the /usr/bin/env assumption is shakier than the /bin/sh
# assumption).

# We have had reports of Netpbm builders who do not have a suitable 
# Perl interpreter at /usr/bin/perl.  They have a downlevel version that
# came with their operating system and can't run configure.pl at
# /usr/bin/perl, and a good Perl interpreter in /usr/local/bin/perl.
