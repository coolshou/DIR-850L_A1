              distributed):

                 1. Corrected the XYZ -> RGB transformation;

                    necessitated by the incorrect XYZ -> RGB transformation;
                 3. Added a Gamma correction, missing in the original;

              this.  pnm_readpnmrow() changed to do same.  external data
              symbols like this do not work with Mingw.

              into memory.  Do multiple passes through the (hopefully
              fully cached) file.  This saves memory because pnmtopng's
              internal format may use 96 times as much space per pixel 
              as the file.

              libpbm: Add pm_openr_seekable(), pm_seek(), pm_tell().

              Split pbmplus.h into pm_config.h and pbm/pm.h to prepare
              for automatic generation of pm_config.h.  Move pm_*()
              subroutines from libpbm1.c to new libpm.c for clarity.

              Remove malloc.h from 411toppm.  malloc is included by
              pm_config.h, in platform-dependent way.

              because of uninitialized variable.

              pnmpsnr: rewritten so as not to use Fiasco library.
              Correctly handles maxval != 255.  Works with PAM.

              Add IRIX to the configure program.  Thanks Neil Franklin

              large images with weird scaling factors.  Add pnmscalefixed,
              which is the old fixed point pnmscale, which goes faster.  But

              Look for both /usr/lib/X11/rgb.txt and /usr/openwin/lib/rgb.txt
              by default.  Improved error messages if file not found.

              pbmtext: renders character codes 0x80-0xff and 0x00-0x1f as
              whatever the font says, rather than always blank.  Thanks

00.04.15 BJH  Release 9.0

              Add the 16-bit-per-sample format for maxval > 255.
              Change size of samples in the library interface from 8
              bits to 32 bits.  Library write routines now create the
              new 16 bit format instead of plain format when you
              request a maxval > 255 and not 'forceplain'.  Make all
              programs read the new format, and all programs that
              convert to PNM from a >8 bit input generate it instead
              of failing or normalizing.  Make pnmdepth generate it.

              pnm_readpnminit(), etc. fails if you request a maxval >
              65535 and not 'forceplain'.  It used to generate plain
              format in that case, but you couldn't actually specify    
              a sample value > 255.

              Add pnmtorle and rletopnm from the Army High Performance 
              Computing Research Center.

              add ppmcolormask - creates a mask of areas of a certain 
              color in an image.

              anytopnm: fix infinite loop
              
              pbmtext:  Ignore non-8-bit characters in bdf files instead
              of crashing.

              ppmdither: fix crash with large dithering matrix dimensions.

              Rename ppmtompeg/headers/search.h to motion_search.h to avoid
              possible confusion with the OSF system file search.h
         
              Fix erroneous shhopt.h dependency in build.
              
00.04.03 BJH  Release 8.4

              mpeg tools.

              Add ppmfade, adapted from Wesley C. Barris' pbmfade. 

              Add ability to extract the alpha channel to tifftopnm,
              tgatoppm, and ximtoppm.  (It's already in pngtoppm,
              and still missing from ilbmtoppm).

              pnmtotiff: Change default compression to none, due to
              removal of LZW capability from Tiff library.

              Make merge build use symbolic links instead of hard links.

              Include dependent libraries in the link of the
              libraries.  This is necessary on some systems, and a
              good idea on others.

              Use strerror() instead of sys_errlist[] everywhere.  If
              some systems do not have the former, we need to do some
              work, because strerror() was already used in some
              places.  We do have a report of a BeOS system with no
              sys_errlist[].

CHANGE LOG FROM PBMPLUS
-----------------------

Changes since the 30oct91 patch version:

    Fixed uninitialized variable in ppmtotga.  (John Walker)
    Added pgmcrater, ppmforge, ppmtoacad, sldtoppm.  (John Walker)
    Slight change to the p?mmerge.c front-ends to allow for main programs

    Fixed xwdtopnm to read some 16-bit True/Direct files. (David Elliott)
    Fixed uninitialized variables in pnmtotiff.  (Larry Rosenstein, Bayles Holt)
    Added a couple of checks for \r while reading whitespace. (Larry Rosenstein)
    Removed all the BROKENPUTC stuff.  Now we ignore all return values from
      putc(), and check ferror() in pm_close().  Added pm_close() calls to
      many of the filters.
    Fixed pnmdepth to check for too-large newmaxvals.  Improved rounding
      in pnmdepth and PPM_DEPTH macro.  (Tom Lane)
    Minor fix to ppmtouil.  (Mohsen Banan)
    Added new Imakefiles.  (Rainer Klute)

Changes since the 05oct91 X11R5 contrib tape version:

    Fixed minor SysV config error in pbmplus.h.  (Tom Lane)
    Fixed tifftopnm so that BITSPERSAMPLE and SAMPLESPERPIXEL default
      correctly.  Fixed possible bug in tgatoppm line-interleaving code.
      (Arthur David Olson)
    Fixed tifftopnm so that colormapped files are read correctly.
      (PauL Drews, Mike Wade)

      image by 2 rows and columns.  Minor fix to pgmramp.  Fixed off-by-one
      error in pnmtoxwd.  Man page fix for pnmgamma.  (Arthur David Olson)
    Converted ANSI trigraphs in ppmtosixel into good old octal.  (Jeff Glover)
    Fix to 24/32 bit case in rasttopnm.  (Behr de Ruiter)
    Float/double portability fix to libppm4.  (Bruce Holmer, Ronald Khoo)
    Fixed typo in compat.ksh.  (Larry Virden)
    Fixed int/short incompatibility in tifftopnm.  (Salik Rafiq)

Changes during the extended beta test period, starting on 15jan91:

    Lots of fixes from: Anthony A. Datri, Arthur David Olson, David Brooks,
      David Elliott, Doug Claar, Duncan Sinclair, Francois Pinard, Gerard
      Leurs, Jim Hanko, Ken Laprade, Klaus U. Schallhorn, Markus Bolz, Mike
      Hench, Philip Gladstone, R C Smith, Selden E. Ball, Jr., Stephen Uitti,

      Charles Karney, Unmesh Agarwala, Ed Pendzik, Juha Sarlin, Tom Tulinsky,
      Phillip Smith, Lai-King Mau, David Koblas, Mark Donovan.
    Added a global -version flag.
    Added bunches of statics and prototypes.  Now compiles with zero
      warnings under gcc -ansi -pedantic.
    Changed #ifdef __STDC__ to #if __STDC__, since some non-compliant
      compilers define it as 0.
    Changed pm_message and pm_error to be varargs routines.  Added a
      portable version of vfprintf for those systems which don't have it.
    Removed the option of not compiling the pgm and ppm parts.  Very few
      people used it, and it added amazing complexity to the pnm programs,
      turning them into maintenance nightmares.
    Merged pbmpaste into pnmpaste.
    Merged pgmtops and ppmtops into pnmtops.
    Added auto-scaling and dpi / page size flags to pnmtops.
    Changed the interpretation of bits in pbmlife to conform with other

      ppmconvol to pnmconvol;
      ppmcscale to pnmdepth;
      ppmrotate to pnmrotate;
      ppmscale to pnmscale;
      ppmshear to pnmshear;
      ppmsmooth to pnmsmooth;
      tifftopgm to tifftopnm - new version based on Sam Leffler's libtiff.
    Bugfixes to pbmtoicon, ppmtops.
    The Makefiles now have a "merge" option.
    All flags are now case-insensitive.
    Added $(MAKE) stuff to Makefile.
    Changed pnmsmooth from a csh script to a sh script.
    Made macro use in pbmtox10bm and pbmtoxbm more portable.
    Moved compataliases to compat.csh, and added compat.ksh.
    Made ppmtoilbm less Amiga-specific.
    Added -headerskip and -rowskip flags to rawtopgm.
    Enhanced rasttopnm to interpret 8-bit rasters with no colormap as grayscale.
    Changed sscanf %g to %f - some systems can't handle %g on input.
    Added -expand flag to pbmmask.
    Speedup to pnmflip - don't buffer if possible.
    Added color-name-to-value routine to ppm - uses X11's rgb.txt if present.
    Updated Imakefile support to reflect X.V11R4.
    Removed picttopbm.
    Improved pnmcut argument syntax so that negative coords work like pnmpaste.
    Added "magic" file, for use with the "file" program.
    40% speedup for pgmnorm from Robert Stockton (rgs@cs.cmu.edu).
    Fixed long-standing bug involving colormaps on SPARCstations when
      compiled with gcc -- had to do with passing structs by value.
    Removed the -x flag from pnmtorast -- it's not really needed.
    Fixed subtle bug in the pnm reading code that caused pnmcat to blow
      it on images that differed greatly in width or height.
    New version of giftoppm that handles the GIF89a standard, and doesn't
      use fseek.
    Fixed fitstopgm to handle three-axis images, such as the Hubble pix.
    Xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd finally handle byte-order properly.
    Added -xysize flag to pnmscale.
    Added conditional ANSI function prototypes to library routines.
    Added -noantialias flag to pnmrotate and pnmshear.
    Removed the TIPS file.  No one ever sent in any new tips, so I just
      moved the few I had into the relevant man pages.  That's probably
      where they belonged in the first place.
    Added justification flags to pnmcat.
    Added -map flag to ppmquant - user-specifiable colormap.  Also, the
      Floyd-Steinberg error diffusion finally works right.
    Added -map flag to pgmtoppm.
    Added DirectColor support to xwdtopnm and pnmtoxwd.
    Speedup to pgmtolj from Arthur David Olson: avoid sending whitespace.

Patch 1 to the X.V11R4 / comp.sources.misc distribution of 22nov89:

    Fixed bug in pgmtops -rle.

Changes since the alt.sources distribution of 13sep89:

    Small corrections to ppmtorast, pgmtops.
    Moved pbm/tifftopbm to pgm/tifftopgm - it now handles grayscale TIFF files.
    Fixed tifftopgm to handle non-native byte order.
    Changes to tifftopgm to handle bogus AppleScan TIFF files, to have
      better command syntax, and to use stdio.
    Optimizations to xbmtopbm, pbmtoxbm, and pbmtox10bm, courtesy of
      Juha Sarlin, to make them go about three times as fast.
    Optimization to pgmtops and ppmtops to make them go three times as fast.
    Optimization to pnmcrop.
    Added PBMPLUS_BROKENPUTC defines in pbmplus.h to handle systems (such as
      ULTRIX) which have broken putc() macros.
    Rewrote ppmscale, pnmcat, and pgmhist to operate line-by-line, instead
      of reading in the whole image.
    Rewrote pnmflip to keep only one copy of the image in memory.
    Added pgmtofits, courtesy of Wilson H. Bent, plus bugfixes to fitstopgm
      and a patch to giftoppm to handle black&white GIF files.
    Added picttopbm and rawtopgm.
    Fixes to xwdtoppm and ppmtoxwd so they compile with SunOS cc as well as gcc.
    Another small change to ppmtoxwd having to do with colormap size.
    Changed macptopbm's -headersize flag to be -extraskip.
    Changed tgatoppm to read color values as BGRA instead of ARGB; the Targa
      documentation is apparently wrong about the order.
    Some changes to the Makefiles, partially to work around bugs in gnumake.
    Got g3topbm working, and added pbmtog3, courtesy of Paul Haeberli.
    Added some pixrect work-alike code so that rasttopbm, pbmtorast, rasttoppm,
      and ppmtorast can be used on non-Sun systems.  This also provides a
      final solution to the persistent byte- and bit-order problems on 386's.
    Moved the SYSV-checking #ifdefs to *after* the include of pbm.h, which
      defines SYSV.
    Made all the #else's and #endif's ANSI-compliant.
    Added manual pages for libpbm, libpgm, libppm, and libpnm, courtesy
      of Tony Hansen.
    Changed man page installation so that pages from different sections
      can go in different directories.
    Fixed Imakefiles.

Changes since the expo.lcs.mit.edu FTP distribution of 06sep89:

    Added #ifdefs to pnm/libpnm3.c to allow the PBM-PNM-only configuration.
    Small corrections to TIPS, pnm/Makefile, pnm/Imakefile, ppm/ppmrotate.1,
      ppm/ppmshear.1, ppm/ppmtoilbm.c, pbm/xwdtopbm.c, ppm/xwdtoppm.c,
      ppm/ppmtoxwd.c, ppm/ppmtoxwd.1, pbm/x11wd.h.

Changes since the comp.sources.misc distribution of 31oct88:

    Added pbmreduce, pbmlife, pbmmask, and pbmupc.
    Added gemtopbm, tifftopbm, pcxtopbm, pbmtogo, mgrtopbm, pbmtomgr,
      cmuwmtopbm, pbmtocmuwm, g3topbm, and pbmtobg.
    Minor bugfix to pbmtolj.
    Slight restructuring of most of the programs to use vastly less memory.
    Various other minor optimizations.
    Fixed pbmtorast and rasttopbm to handle byte-swapped big-endian 386 boxes.
    Slight changes to argument syntax of pbmcrop, pbmmake, pbmreduce.
    Moved to the new PGM package: pbmtops (which now produces Conforming PS).
    Moved to the new PPM package: giftopbm.
    Moved to the new PNM package: pbmcrop pbmcut pbmenlarge pbminvert.
    Consolidated into a single pnmflip tool: pbmfliplr pbmfliptb pbmtrnspos.
    Consolidated into a single pnmcat tool: pbmcatlr pbmcattb.
    Added compataliases script for upward compatability with changed tools.
    Removed xxxtopbm.
    Added a -headersize flag to macptopbm, to help get around annoying
      problems in MacPaint file format.
    Added the RAWBITS compilation-time option, to use a more compact and
      much faster (but less portable) external format.
    Removed the CBM format - use compress(1) and / or RAWBITS instead.
    Pbmpaste (and the new pnmpaste) now accepts negative x and y coords,
      which are interpreted relative to the right and bottom sides.
    Changed all programs to accept a "-" file argument as meaning standard
      input.
    Removed pbmtox10wd, since it was never very useful (X10 doesn't have xwud).
    Added Imakefiles, for X11 types to use.

Changes since the X.V11R3 distribution of 31aug88:

    The cbm format has been revised to support run-length encoding.
    Pbmtops now does run-length encoding.

Major changes since the X.V11R2 distribution of 28mar88:

    The pbm format now has a "magic number".
    New conversion filters: brushtopbm, giftopbm, pbmtolj, pbmtomacp,
      pbmtoxwd, and pbmtox10wd.
    Icontopbm converter has a better parser -- it knows to skip over
      any extraneous comments at the beginning of the icon file.
    Pbmtops generates a different PostScript wrapper program -- it should
      handle huge bitmaps better.
    Xwdtopbm now handles byte-swapping correctly.
    Pbmmake takes a flag to specify the color of the new bitmap.
    Pbmpaste now implements 'or', 'and', and 'xor' operations as well
      as the default 'replace'.
