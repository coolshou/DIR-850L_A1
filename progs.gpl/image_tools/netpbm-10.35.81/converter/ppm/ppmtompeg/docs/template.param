# parameter file template with lots of comments to assist you
#
# you can use this as a template, copying it to a separate file then modifying
# the copy
#
#
# any line beginning with '#' is a comment
#
# no line should be longer than 255 characters
#
#
# general format of each line is:
#	<option> <spaces and/or tabs> <value>
#
# lines can generally be in any order
#
# an exception is the option 'INPUT' which must be followed by input
# files in the order in which they must appear, followed by 'END_INPUT'
#
# Also, if you use the `command` method of generating input file names,
# the command will only be executed in the INPUT_DIR if INPUT_DIR preceeds
# the INPUT parameter.
#
# <option> MUST be in UPPER CASE
#

PATTERN		IBBPBBPBBPBBPBBP
OUTPUT		output.mpg

# mpeg_encode really only accepts 3 different file formats, but using a
# conversion statement it can effectively handle ANY file format
#
# You must specify the type of the input files.  The choices are:
#    YUV, PPM, JMOVIE, Y, JPEG, PNM
#	(must be upper case)
#
BASE_FILE_FORMAT	YUV

#
# if YUV format (or using parallel version), must provide width and height
# YUV_SIZE	widthxheight
# this option is ignored if BASE_FILE_FORMAT is not YUV and you're running
# on just one machine
#
YUV_SIZE	352x240

# If you are using YUV, there are different supported file formats.
# EYUV or UCB are the same as previous versions of this encoder.
# (All the Y's, then U's then V's, in 4:2:0 subsampling.)
# Other formats, such as Abekas, Phillips, or a general format are
# permissible, the general format is a string of Y's, U's, and V's
# to specify the file order.

INPUT_FORMAT UCB

# the conversion statement
#
# Each occurrence of '*' will be replaced by the input file
#
# e.g., if you have a bunch of GIF files, then this might be:
#	INPUT_CONVERT	giftoppm *
#
# e.g., if you have a bunch of files like a.Y a.U a.V, etc., then:
#	INPUT_CONVERT	cat *.Y *.U *.V
#
# e.g., if you are grabbing from laser disc you might have something like
#	INPUT_CONVERT	goto frame *; grabppm
# 'INPUT_CONVERT *' means the files are already in the base file format
#
INPUT_CONVERT	*

# number of frames in a GOP.
#
# since each GOP must have at least one I-frame, the encoder will find the
# the first I-frame after GOP_SIZE frames to start the next GOP
#
# later, will add more flexible GOP signalling
#
GOP_SIZE	16

# number of slices in a frame
#
# 1 is a good number.  another possibility is the number of macroblock rows
# (which is the height divided by 16)
#
SLICES_PER_FRAME	1

# directory to get all input files from (makes this file easier to read)
INPUT_DIR	../input/tennis

# There are a bunch of ways to specify the input files.
# from a simple one-per-line listing, to the following 
# way of numbering them.  See the manual for more information.
INPUT
# '*' is replaced by the numbers 01, 02, 03, 04
# if I instead do [01-11], it would be 01, 02, ..., 09, 10, 11
# if I instead do [1-11], it would be 1, 2, 3, ..., 9, 10, 11
# if I instead do [1-11+3], it would be 1, 4, 7, 10
# the program assumes none of your input files has a name ending in ']'
# if you do, too bad!!!
#
#
stennis.*.yuv	[0-23]
# can have more files here if you want...there is no limit on the number
# of files
END_INPUT



# Many of the remaining options have to do with the motion search and qscale

# FULL or HALF -- must be upper case
PIXEL		HALF

# means +/- this many pixels for both P and B frame searches
# specify two numbers if you wish to serc different ranges in the two.
RANGE		10

# this must be one of {EXHAUSTIVE, SUBSAMPLE, LOGARITHMIC}
PSEARCH_ALG	LOGARITHMIC

# this must be one of {SIMPLE, CROSS2, EXHAUSTIVE}
#
# note that EXHAUSTIVE is really, really, really slow
#
BSEARCH_ALG	CROSS2

#
# these specify the q-scale for I, P, and B frames
# (values must be between 1 and 31)
# These are the Qscale values for the entire frame in variable bit-rate
# mode, and starting points (but not important) for constant bit rate
#
IQSCALE		8
PQSCALE		10
BQSCALE		25

# this must be ORIGINAL or DECODED
REFERENCE_FRAME	ORIGINAL

# for parallel parameters see parallel.param in the exmaples subdirectory

# if you want constant bit-rate mode, specify it as follows (number is bits/sec):
BIT_RATE  1000000

# To specify the buffer size (327680 is default, measused in bits, for 16bit words)
BUFFER_SIZE 327680

# The frame rate is the number of frames/second (legal values:
# 23.976, 24, 25, 29.97, 30, 50 ,59.94, 60
FRAME_RATE 30

# There are many more options, see the users manual for examples....
# ASPECT_RATIO, USER_DATA, GAMMA, IQTABLE, etc.
