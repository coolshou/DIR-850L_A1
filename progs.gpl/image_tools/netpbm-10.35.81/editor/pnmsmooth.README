README for pnmsmooth.c 2.0

This is a replacement for the pnmsmooth script that is distributed with
pbmplus/netpbm.  This version of pnmsmooth is written as a C program rather
than a shell script.  It accepts command line arguments to specify a size 
other than 3x3 for the convolution matrix and an argument for dumping the 
resultant convolution matrix as a PGM file.  By default it uses the same 3x3
matrix size as the pnmsmooth script and can be used as a direct replacement.

Also included are an updated man page and a patch file to update the Imakefile
in the pnm directory.  You may want to apply the patches by hand if you have
already modified the Imakefile to add other new programs.   You will then
have to remake the Makefiles and then type 'make all' in the pnm directory.
